# Nethereum.BlockchainStorage

## Summary

This repo is for projects that extend block chain processing.

**WARNING** - this is a work in progress!  Many of the projects in their current state will fail to build because of failed dependencies.

We are busy porting processing code from the existing BlockchainProcessing repo to the Nethereum core repository.  

Then projects in this storage repo will reference that (via nuget soon).
